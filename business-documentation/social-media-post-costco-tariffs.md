## POST: Costco Tariff Lawsuit - Supply Chain Transparency & Policy Impact

### Full Post Text:

Costco just joined a growing list of companies suing the Trump administration over emergency tariffs. They're not just seeking refunds—they're fighting for something supply chains desperately need: **predictable rules**.

Here's what matters:

**The Legal Fight:**
Costco argues the emergency tariffs lacked proper authority under IEEPA. With a December 15 liquidation deadline looming, once duties are locked in, refunds become nearly impossible—even if courts rule the tariffs unlawful.

**Who Else Is Pushing Back:**
Kawasaki Motors, Revlon, EssilorLuxottica, Learning Resources, and V.O.S. Selections are all challenging the same program. This isn't one company—it's a pattern.

**The Real Cost:**
According to a recent report, tariffs changed **every four days in 2025**. Retailers with narrow margins and seasonal demand can't plan around that kind of volatility. The uncertainty doesn't just add costs—it cascades through entire supply chains.

**The Bigger Picture:**
A trade court recently invalidated earlier tariff actions using the same emergency powers. This case could reach the Supreme Court in 2026, potentially forcing billions in refunds and reshaping sourcing decisions across retail and manufacturing.

At **Value Chain Hackers**, we research how policy uncertainty impacts supply chain finance, transparency, and resilience. When the rules change every four days, supply chains can't optimize—they just react.

**The question for 2026:** How do we build supply chains that can absorb policy shocks without breaking?
