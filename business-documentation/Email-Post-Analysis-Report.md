**Subject: 2 LinkedIn Posts Ready**

Hey team,

Two posts ready in POST-1-Costco-Tariffs-READY.md and POST-2-Manufacturing-Contraction-READY.md. 

Post 1  talks about policy chaos when rules change every four days. Post 2 (manufacturing contraction) connects the dots to supply chain finance impact: 14 months of lean inventories isn't efficiency, it's fear. 


Together they show the problem and the consequences. Both end with questions to drive engagement, and we're analyzing financial impact instead of just sharing news.
