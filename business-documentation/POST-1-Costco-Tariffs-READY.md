Costco is suing the Trump administration. So are Kawasaki Motors, Revlon, EssilorLuxottica, and a bunch of other companies.

Why? Emergency tariffs that keep changing.

Get this: tariffs changed every FOUR DAYS in 2025. Every. Four. Days.

You can't build a supply chain strategy around that. You can't forecast costs. You can't negotiate with suppliers. You can't even tell your finance team what next quarter looks like. You just… react and hope.

Here's the kicker: December 15 is the liquidation deadline. After that, even if courts rule these tariffs were illegal, getting refunds becomes almost impossible. So companies are fighting NOW.

This isn't just about money. It's about something supply chains need to function: predictable rules. When policy whiplash happens every 96 hours, optimization dies. Planning dies. You're just in survival mode.

At Value Chain Hackers, this is exactly what we research. How do supply chain finance models hold up when the regulatory ground keeps shifting? How do you build transparency when the rules won't sit still? How do you maintain resilience when "the plan" changes faster than you can execute it?

Real question: How is your organization handling this? Are you diversifying suppliers, absorbing costs, or just passing everything through and hoping customers don't bail?
