## Project Overview

The Cacao Chain Transparency Initiative represents a deep investigation into the complex and often opaque supply chain connecting West African cacao farmers to Dutch chocolate consumers. Building on the foundation laid by the earlier Green Cacao Guide project, this initiative focused specifically on improving traceability, ensuring fair value distribution, and empowering smallholder farmers through transparency technology.

Working closely with Chocolate Makers Amsterdam, a craft chocolate company committed to direct trade relationships, the team explored how emerging technologies like blockchain, QR code tracking, and digital payment systems could transform an industry historically characterized by exploitation and opacity.

### The Challenge

The cacao industry faces profound ethical and economic challenges that have persisted for generations:

**Farmer Poverty Crisis:**
- Average cacao farmer in Ghana earns €0.50-0.80 per day (below poverty line)
- Farmers receive only 6-8% of final chocolate bar retail price
- Lack of price transparency leaves farmers vulnerable to exploitation
- Children in farming families often unable to afford education

**Supply Chain Opacity:**
- 5-7 intermediaries between farmer and chocolate maker
- No traceability: chocolate companies cannot identify which farms their beans come from
- Quality premiums rarely reach farmers who produce superior beans
- Certification schemes (Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance) add costs but limited farmer benefit

**Market Structure Problems:**
- Commodity pricing based on London/New York exchanges, disconnected from farming reality
- Farmers have no negotiating power as individual smallholders
- Cooperative structures vary widely in effectiveness and transparency
- Climate change increasing production costs while prices remain stagnant

**Consumer Disconnect:**
- Consumers willing to pay premium for ethical chocolate but cannot verify claims
- "Fair Trade" labels provide limited actual information about farmer compensation
- No direct connection between consumer purchase and farmer livelihood

### Research Questions

The team focused on three core questions:

1. **Traceability:** How can we create end-to-end traceability from individual farmer to chocolate bar at minimal cost?
2. **Value Distribution:** What percentage of retail price reaches farmers, and how can this be increased?
3. **Technology Adoption:** What digital tools can farmers realistically adopt given infrastructure constraints?

## Research Approach

The team conducted a 6-month investigation combining supply chain mapping, farmer interviews (via cooperative), and technology assessment.

### Methodology

**1. Supply Chain Mapping**

Created detailed maps of two distinct supply chain models:

**Traditional Commodity Model:**
1. Smallholder farmers (1-3 hectare plots)
2. Local buying agents (often exploitative pricing)
3. Licensed buying companies
4. Export companies
5. International traders
6. Chocolate manufacturers
7. Distributors
8. Retailers

**Direct Trade Model (Chocolate Makers):**
1. Farmer cooperative (organized smallholders)
2. Cooperative management (quality control, fermentation)
3. Direct purchase by Chocolate Makers
4. Dutch processing and manufacturing
5. Direct-to-consumer sales + specialty retail

**Key Finding:** Direct trade eliminates 4-5 intermediaries, but still faces transparency and farmer verification challenges.

**2. Stakeholder Interviews**

**Chocolate Makers Amsterdam Interview (March 11, 2025):**
- 90-minute recorded interview with sourcing director
- Explored current direct trade practices
- Identified pain points in farmer payment verification
- Discussed willingness to adopt traceability technology
- Learned about quality premiums and pricing structure

**Farmer Cooperative Communication (via Chocolate Makers):**
- Indirect communication through cooperative leadership
- Gathered data on farmer income, farm sizes, challenges
- Assessed technology access (mobile phones, internet)
- Identified farmer priorities: stable pricing, advance payments, quality premiums

**3. Economic Analysis**

Conducted detailed breakdown of chocolate bar pricing:

**Traditional €4.50 Chocolate Bar (100g):**
- Cacao beans (farm gate): €0.27 (6%)
- Cooperative/processing: €0.36 (8%)
- Export/shipping: €0.54 (12%)
- Manufacturing: €0.90 (20%)
- Marketing/distribution: €1.35 (30%)
- Retail margin: €1.08 (24%)

**Chocolate Makers Direct Trade Bar (€5.50):**
- Cacao beans (farm gate): €0.66 (12%) ← 2x higher
- Cooperative: €0.44 (8%)
- Direct shipping: €0.55 (10%)
- Manufacturing: €1.10 (20%)
- Marketing/distribution: €1.65 (30%)
- Retail margin: €1.10 (20%)

**Insight:** Even with direct trade doubling farmer payment, farmers still receive only 12% of retail price. Room for significant improvement.

**4. Technology Assessment**

Evaluated 6 traceability technologies for feasibility:

| Technology | Farmer Adoption Barrier | Cost per Farm | Traceability Quality | Verdict |
|------------|------------------------|---------------|---------------------|----------|
| Blockchain (complex) | High - requires smartphones, internet | €200-500/year | Excellent | ❌ Too complex |
| QR Code + SMS | Low - works on basic phones | €20-50/year | Good | ✅ Viable |
| GPS Mapping | Medium - requires smartphone | €100-200/year | Excellent | ⚠️ Possible |
| Photo Documentation | Low - basic phones sufficient | €10-30/year | Fair | ✅ Viable |
| Digital Wallets | Medium - requires training | €50-100/year | N/A (payment tool) | ✅ High value |
| Paper + Digital Hybrid | Very Low - no tech required | €5-15/year | Fair | ✅ Transition tool |

**5. Farmer Income Modeling**

Projected impact of improved traceability and value distribution:

**Current State (Traditional Supply Chain):**
- Average farm: 2 hectares
- Annual production: 800 kg dried beans
- Income: €640-800/year
- Daily income: €1.75-2.20 (below poverty line)

**Direct Trade (Current Chocolate Makers Model):**
- Annual production: 800 kg
- Income: €1,280-1,600/year (2x improvement)
- Daily income: €3.50-4.40 (approaching living wage)

**Proposed Enhanced Model (Traceability + Quality Premiums):**
- Base price: Same as direct trade
- Quality premium (top 30% farmers): +€200-300/year
- Yield premium (sustainable practices): +€150-250/year
- Total potential income: €1,630-2,150/year
- Daily income: €4.47-5.89 (above living wage threshold)

## Key Findings

### Supply Chain Insights

**1. The "Missing Middle" Problem**

**Discovery:** Between farmer cooperative and chocolate maker, there's minimal value-add but significant cost markup.

**Current Reality:**
- Export companies charge 15-20% markup for logistics and paperwork
- International traders add 10-15% for market access and risk management
- Combined: 25-35% of value extracted with minimal farmer benefit

**Opportunity:**
- Direct digital payment systems could eliminate trader markup
- Cooperative could handle export logistics with capacity building
- Savings could increase farmer income by 20-30% without increasing chocolate prices

**2. Quality Premium Disconnect**

**Problem:** Chocolate Makers pays premium price to cooperative for high-quality beans, but individual farmers producing superior beans receive same price as average quality producers.

**Current System:**
- Cooperative pools all beans and pays uniform price
- No incentive for individual farmers to invest in quality improvement
- Best farmers subsidize worst farmers

**Impact:**
- Quality farmers frustrated, consider leaving cooperative
- Overall quality stagnates rather than improves
- Chocolate makers cannot source ultra-premium beans

**Solution Needed:** Individual farm traceability to enable quality-based payments.

**3. Transparency Theater**

**Finding:** Current "transparency" initiatives often misleading:

**Fair Trade Certification:**
- Certification costs: €2,000-5,000 per cooperative annually
- Fair Trade premium: €200-400 per metric ton
- For typical farmer: €16-32 per year increase
- After deducting certification costs: Negligible net benefit

**Direct Trade Claims:**
- "Direct trade" has no standard definition
- Some companies claim "direct trade" but still use 3-4 intermediaries
- Without traceability, claims cannot be verified

**Consumer Perception Gap:**
- 68% of consumers believe "Fair Trade" means farmers receive 30-40% of bar price
- Reality: Still only 8-12% even with certification
- Transparency critical to building genuine trust

**4. Mobile Money Revolution Potential**

**Infrastructure Reality in Ghana:**
- 83% of farmers have mobile phones (but 65% are basic, not smartphones)
- 47% of farmers use mobile money for other transactions
- Existing infrastructure: MTN Mobile Money, Vodafone Cash widely used

**Opportunity:**
- Piggyback on existing mobile money infrastructure
- Direct payments from chocolate company to farmer mobile wallet
- Eliminates cash handling, reduces corruption, provides payment records
- Farmers already understand the technology

**Barrier:**
- Cooperatives concerned about loss of control
- Cultural: farmers trust cooperative leaders more than foreign companies
- Need to integrate mobile payments while maintaining cooperative relationship

### Farmer Perspectives

**Key Insights from Cooperative Communications:**

**Farmer Priority #1: Price Stability**
- Quote: "We can accept lower prices if we know what to expect. The uncertainty is what destroys us."
- Cacao prices fluctuate 30-50% annually
- Long-term contracts with fixed pricing more valuable than occasional premiums

**Farmer Priority #2: Access to Credit**
- Farm input costs (fertilizer, tools) due before harvest
- Local loan sharks charge 50-100% interest rates
- Advance payments or cooperative credit at fair rates highly valued

**Farmer Priority #3: Respect and Recognition**
- "We work hard to produce quality, but no one knows our names"
- Desire for chocolate companies to acknowledge individual farmers
- Simple recognition (name on website, certificate) highly motivating

**Technology Adoption Reality:**
- Farmers willing to adopt technology IF:
  - Clear benefit demonstrated (higher prices, faster payments)
  - Training provided in local language
  - Technology works reliably (poor internet a major barrier)
  - Cooperative leadership endorses it

## Solution Framework: Farmer-First Traceability System

Based on research findings, the team designed a pragmatic traceability system optimized for farmer benefit and realistic adoption constraints.

### System Architecture

#### **Level 1: Farm Registration & Mapping**

**Goal:** Create database of individual farms with basic information

**Data Collected:**
- Farmer name and contact (mobile phone number)
- Farm location (GPS coordinates or village name + landmarks)
- Farm size (hectares)
- Trees planted (approximate count)
- Farm age and variety of cacao

**Technology:**
- One-time GPS mapping using smartphone carried by cooperative field agent
- Paper registration form as backup
- Photo of farmer with farm (basic phone sufficient)

**Implementation:**
- Cooperative field agents visit each farm once
- Data entered into simple web database
- Each farmer assigned unique 6-digit ID code

**Cost:** €2-3 per farm (one-time)

#### **Level 2: Harvest Tracking**

**Goal:** Link specific bean batches to individual farmers

**Process:**
1. Farmer brings wet beans to cooperative collection center
2. Beans weighed and quality assessed (visual inspection)
3. Farmer receives paper receipt with: weight, quality grade, farmer ID, date
4. Beans labeled with farmer ID during fermentation
5. QR code sticker applied to dried bean bags

**Technology:**
- Digital scale with SMS capability (texts weight to central database)
- Pre-printed QR code stickers
- Basic phone SMS for farmers (delivery receipt + price)

**Cost:** €0.15-0.25 per harvest transaction

#### **Level 3: Quality-Based Pricing**

**Goal:** Reward farmers who produce superior beans

**Quality Grades:**
- **Grade A (Premium):** Well-fermented, uniform size, <3% defects → +20% price
- **Grade B (Standard):** Good fermentation, <8% defects → Base price
- **Grade C (Below Standard):** Poor fermentation or high defects → -15% price

**Payment Structure:**
- Base price: €1.60/kg (direct trade rate)
- Grade A premium: €1.92/kg
- Grade C discount: €1.36/kg

**Expected Distribution:**
- Grade A: 25-30% of farmers (after training)
- Grade B: 60-65%
- Grade C: 5-10%

**Impact:**
- Top farmers earn 20-40% more annually
- Incentivizes investment in fermentation quality
- Cooperative overall quality improves, enabling higher premiums from Chocolate Makers

#### **Level 4: Consumer Transparency**

**Goal:** Connect consumers to specific farmers

**Consumer Experience:**
1. Scan QR code on chocolate bar with smartphone
2. See: farmer name, farm location (map), farm photo, harvest date
3. Read: farmer's story (translated to Dutch), farm practices
4. Optional: Send message of thanks to farmer (via SMS)

**Farmer Experience:**
- Receives SMS: "Your beans were made into chocolate by Chocolate Makers! A customer in Amsterdam sent you this message: [message]"
- Creates emotional connection and motivation
- Farmers can see their work's impact

**Technology:**
- Web platform (responsive mobile design)
- QR code on every chocolate bar
- SMS gateway for farmer messages (€0.03 per message)

**Cost:** €0.10-0.15 per chocolate bar (QR code + platform)

#### **Level 5: Digital Payments**

**Goal:** Enable direct, transparent payment from chocolate company to farmer

**Payment Flow:**
1. Chocolate Makers purchases beans from cooperative
2. Payment split automatically:
   - 70% to individual farmer mobile wallets (based on harvest records)
   - 30% to cooperative (services: fermentation, quality control, export logistics)
3. Farmers receive SMS: "Payment received: GH₵ 450 from Chocolate Makers for 120kg Grade A beans"

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates cash handling and theft risk
- Provides digital payment record (useful for credit applications)
- Reduces corruption (all transactions recorded)
- Instant payment confirmation

**Infrastructure:**
- Integration with MTN Mobile Money or Vodafone Cash
- Cooperative maintains oversight but cannot delay/withhold payments

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

**✅ Farmer-Centric Design**
- Involving cooperative leaders early ensured farmer perspective central
- Simple, pragmatic technology choices increased adoption likelihood
- Focus on farmer income (not just "transparency") created buy-in

**✅ Economic Modeling**
- Detailed price breakdown revealed where value was lost
- Quantifying farmer income impact made compelling business case
- Chocolate Makers could see profitability maintained while improving farmer pay

**✅ Leveraging Existing Infrastructure**
- Building on mobile money infrastructure avoided reinventing wheel
- Cooperative's existing quality control process adapted rather than replaced
- Reduced costs and complexity significantly

### Challenges Encountered

**⚠️ Cooperative Power Dynamics**
- Cooperative leaders initially resistant to direct farmer payments (loss of control)
- Required extensive negotiation and compromise (30% payment to cooperative preserved)
- Highlighted that cooperatives are not monolithic "good actors" - politics matter

**⚠️ Technology Reliability Concerns**
- Internet connectivity in rural Ghana unpredictable
- SMS-based systems more reliable but limited functionality
- Hybrid paper/digital system essential but adds complexity

**⚠️ Scaling Challenges**
- System designed for 300-400 farmers in one cooperative
- Scaling to thousands of farmers across multiple countries requires significant infrastructure
- Each country has different mobile money providers, regulations, cooperative structures

**⚠️ Consumer Engagement Uncertainty**
- QR code scan rates highly uncertain (5-8% estimate, could be 1-2% in reality)
- Consumer interest in farmer stories may fade over time
- Need ongoing marketing to drive engagement

## Business Model & Sustainability

### Revenue Streams

**Option 1: Chocolate Maker Subscription**
- Annual fee: €5,000-8,000 per chocolate maker
- Covers: platform access, QR codes, payment processing
- Justification: Saves marketing costs (transparency as differentiator) + risk mitigation (EUDR compliance)

**Option 2: Cost-per-Transaction**
- €0.20-0.30 per harvest transaction
- Covers: payment processing, database maintenance, SMS costs
- Scales with volume

**Option 3: Grant-Funded Public Good**
- Funded by development organizations (e.g., Dutch development bank FMO, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation)
- Free for farmers and chocolate makers
- Maintains independence from commercial pressures

**Recommended Hybrid:** Grant-funded pilot (2 years) → transition to subscription model for sustainability

### Financial Projections (Year 3)

- Grant funding (tapering): €120,000/year
- **Total:** €157,000/year

**Year 3 Funding Gap:** €31,000 (requires additional chocolate makers or higher subscription fees)

**Path to Sustainability:** 8-10 chocolate makers or 6,000+ transactions annually

## Team Reflections

### Nina Visser (Supply Chain Research Lead)

*"This project fundamentally changed how I think about 'ethical consumption.' I used to believe that buying Fair Trade chocolate meant farmers were paid fairly. The reality is far more complex. Fair Trade helps, but it's not nearly enough. What struck me most was meeting (via video) farmers who work incredibly hard, produce a luxury product, yet live in poverty. The fact that we can design a system that doubles or triples their income without making chocolate unaffordable shows that the problem isn't economic scarcity—it's how value is distributed. Technology can help, but only if we center farmer needs, not just consumer feel-good stories."*

### Tom Hendriks (Technology & Implementation Lead)

*"I started this project thinking blockchain would solve everything. It doesn't. The most valuable technology was the simplest: SMS and mobile money, which farmers already use. This taught me that innovation isn't always about the newest tech—it's about understanding the context and constraints. One of my proudest moments was when a Ghanaian cooperative leader said our system 'makes sense' because it worked with their existing processes, not against them. If I could give one piece of advice to future projects: spend twice as long listening to the people you're trying to help as you do designing solutions."*
