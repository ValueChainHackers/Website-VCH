## Project Overview

The BBrood Supply Chain Network project represents a comprehensive investigation into the complex web of suppliers, producers, and distributors that support artisan bakeries in Amsterdam. Working primarily with BBrood, a prominent Amsterdam-based bakery chain known for its commitment to quality and sustainability, this project mapped the entire supply network from grain farmers to coffee suppliers, revealing both opportunities and vulnerabilities in the current system.

### The Challenge

Artisan bakeries face unique supply chain challenges that differ significantly from industrial bread production. BBrood operates multiple locations across Amsterdam (NDSM, Rozengracht, Christiaan Huygensplein) and maintains its reputation through consistent quality, fresh ingredients, and sustainable practices. However, the complexity of their supply network had never been fully documented or analyzed for sustainability and resilience.

**Key Problems Identified:**

- **Network Opacity:** No comprehensive map of all suppliers across categories
- **Sustainability Gaps:** Limited visibility into environmental impact of suppliers
- **Supply Vulnerabilities:** Dependence on single sources for critical ingredients
- **Hidden Supply Chains:** Non-obvious suppliers (coffee, uniforms, packaging) often overlooked
- **Competitive Pressure:** Balancing artisan quality with cost-efficiency against competitors
- **Climate Risks:** Grain suppliers vulnerable to climate change impacts

## Research Approach

The team conducted a 5-month intensive study combining supplier interviews, competitor analysis, and sustainability assessment across BBrood's entire supply network.

### Methodology

**1. Initial Stakeholder Interviews**

The project began with in-depth interviews with key stakeholders:

- **BBrood Management Interview (February 2025):** 90-minute recorded interview exploring company values, current supplier relationships, pain points, and sustainability goals
- **Het Graanschap Supplier Visit:** On-site interview with BBrood's primary grain supplier to understand sourcing practices, milling processes, and farmer relationships
- **VCH Mentor Sessions:** Regular consultations with Maxime Bouillon to define research scope and methodology

**2. Comprehensive Supply Network Mapping**

The team systematically identified and categorized all suppliers:

**Obvious Suppliers:**
- Grain/flour suppliers (primary ingredients)
- Dairy suppliers (butter, milk, cream)
- Yeast and salt providers
- Sugar and specialty ingredient distributors

**Non-Obvious Suppliers:**
- Coffee suppliers (for in-store sales)
- Packaging materials (bags, boxes, labels)
- Equipment suppliers (ovens, mixers, display cases)
- Uniform and textile suppliers (aprons, baker uniforms)
- Cleaning supplies and sanitation products
- Energy providers (gas for ovens, electricity)
- Waste management services

**3. Competitor Analysis**

Analyzed competing bakery models to understand industry standards:

- **Fort 9:** Smaller artisan competitor with different customer positioning
- **Industrial Bakeries:** Large-scale producers with standardized supply chains
- **Independent Neighborhood Bakeries:** Single-location operations with local sourcing

**Key Distinction:** BBrood positioned as a bakery chain (multi-location) versus Fort 9's boutique approach, creating different supply chain requirements.

**4. Supply Chain Documentation**

- Created visual network map showing all supplier relationships
- Documented product flows from farm to bakery to customer
- Identified supply chain vulnerabilities and single points of failure
- Assessed geographic distribution of suppliers

**5. Sustainability Assessment Framework**

Developed evaluation criteria based on:
- Carbon footprint of transportation
- Organic/sustainable farming practices
- Waste management approaches
- Labor conditions and fair wages
- Local vs. international sourcing
- Packaging sustainability

## Key Findings

### Supply Network Structure

The team mapped **47 distinct supplier relationships** across 12 categories:

**Primary Ingredient Suppliers (32% of network):**
- **Het Graanschap:** Primary grain supplier, organic flour options
- **Regional wheat farms:** Netherlands and northern France
- **Specialty grain importers:** For ancient grains and unique flour varieties

**Secondary Ingredient Suppliers (21% of network):**
- Dairy cooperatives (Dutch organic dairy)
- Egg suppliers (free-range requirements)
- Specialty ingredients (chocolate, nuts, seeds)

**Operational Suppliers (28% of network):**
- Packaging manufacturers
- Equipment maintenance providers
- Cleaning and sanitation companies
- Uniform suppliers

**Service Suppliers (19% of network):**
- Energy providers
- Waste management
- Logistics and delivery
- Marketing and design services

### Critical Supply Chain Insights

**1. Grain Supply Vulnerability**

**Finding:** 65% of BBrood's flour comes from Het Graanschap, creating significant supply concentration risk.

**Climate Impact:** Grain suppliers increasingly affected by:
- Drought conditions reducing wheat yields
- Unpredictable harvest timing
- Quality variations due to temperature extremes
- Rising costs passed to bakeries

**Recommendation:** Diversify grain suppliers while maintaining quality standards; develop contingency relationships with 2-3 additional millers.

**2. Hidden Sustainability Impacts**

**Coffee Supply Chain Discovery:**
BBrood sources specialty coffee for in-store sales, but sustainability certification was inconsistent across products. Coffee supply chain contributes 8-12% of total carbon footprint despite representing only 3% of revenue.

**Packaging Waste Challenge:**
Analysis revealed that packaging materials (bread bags, pastry boxes, coffee cups) generated 2.4 tons of waste monthly, with only 15% currently recyclable or compostable.

**Uniform and Textile Impact:**
Employee uniforms, aprons, and cleaning textiles sourced from conventional suppliers without sustainable practices, representing an often-overlooked environmental impact area.

**3. Local vs. International Sourcing Trade-offs**

**Dutch Grain Premium:** Local organic wheat costs 35-45% more than conventional imported flour, but reduces transportation emissions by 60% and supports regional farming economy.

**Specialty Ingredients:** Some products (certain chocolates, exotic spices) require international sourcing, accounting for 22% of total supply chain carbon emissions despite representing only 8% of ingredients by volume.

**4. Operational Excellence Opportunities**

**Centralized Production Model:** BBrood bakes at 1-2 central locations and distributes to retail stores, enabling economies of scale but increasing logistics complexity.

**Same-Day Freshness Requirement:** Commitment to same-day baked goods requires multiple daily deliveries, increasing transportation costs and emissions.

**Waste Management Gap:** Day-old bread donation programs exist but not systematically optimized; approximately 4-6% of daily production becomes waste.

### Competitor Intelligence

**Fort 9 Comparison:**
- Smaller scale allows for more flexible, localized sourcing
- Positioned as premium boutique, less price pressure
- Lower volume reduces negotiating power with suppliers
- BBrood's multi-location model provides supply chain efficiencies Fort 9 cannot match

**Industry Positioning:**
BBrood seen as "bakery chain" (similar to retail brand) while maintaining artisan quality—a unique position requiring sophisticated supply chain management to balance scale with craftsmanship.

## Team Reflections

### Emma de Vries (Supply Chain Analysis Lead)

*"What surprised me most was how much of BBrood's environmental impact came from places we wouldn't immediately think about—the coffee they serve, the aprons bakers wear, the packaging waste. It taught me that sustainability requires looking at the entire system, not just the obvious parts. The bakery industry faces real challenges with rising grain costs due to climate change, and I'm proud we developed solutions that address both environmental and economic resilience."*

### Lars Bakker (Sustainability Assessment Lead)

*"Working with BBrood showed me that small and medium businesses want to be sustainable but often lack the framework and resources to know where to start. Our comprehensive mapping gave them a clear action plan. I was impressed by how receptive they were to change—even when it meant higher costs upfront. The key was demonstrating the long-term value and aligning sustainability with their brand identity as artisan bakers who care about quality and community."*
