# Background
background: |
  The Green Cacao Guide was created during a 6-month internship with Value Chain Hackers to address sustainability challenges in the cacao industry. The project focused on providing actionable, realistic solutions for small Dutch chocolate companies that want to become more sustainable but don't know where to start.

  Through extensive research, industry interviews, and collaboration with experts like Chocolatemakers, the team developed a comprehensive guide covering production practices, land management, trade systems, financing tools, and transparency methods.

## About the Project

*"Small steps can lead to meaningful progress."* This philosophy drives The Green Cacao Guide, a comprehensive resource designed to help small Dutch chocolate companies navigate the complex landscape of sustainable cacao sourcing.

### The Challenge

The cacao industry faces significant sustainability challenges across three key areas:

**Planet:**
- Land degradation and deforestation
- Drought and water stress
- Loss of biodiversity

**People:**
- Modern slavery and child labor
- Lack of economic resilience for farmers
- Poverty in farming communities

**Profit:**
- Unstable long-term supply chains
- Lack of transparency for consumers
- Unfair comparisons between brands due to certification costs

### Our Approach

Over six months, Suzie Smit and Lonneke Oostmeijer conducted deep research into sustainable cacao supply chains. They interviewed industry experts, analyzed existing chocolate company practices (including Tony Chocolonely and Chocolatemakers), and mapped various supply chain models to identify realistic, actionable solutions.

### The Guide Structure

The final guide provides step-by-step implementations across three main areas:

#### 1. Production and Land Management
- **Agroforestry**: Multi-strata planting systems that mimic natural forest ecosystems
- **Permaculture**: Sustainable food systems that work with nature, not against it
- **Rehabilitation**: Pruning, replanting, and grafting techniques to improve tree productivity
- **Broadening Farmers' Tasks**: Empowering farmers with fermentation and drying responsibilities

#### 2. Trade and Financing
- **Direct Trade**: Building relationships directly with farmers or cooperatives
- **Digital Systems**: Using AI, blockchain, and satellite technology for traceability
- **Financing Tools**: Digital payments, microfinance, and Village Savings & Loan Associations

#### 3. Transparency and Awareness
- **Certification Limitations**: Understanding the unfair comparison created by expensive certifications
- **Independent Research**: Conducting your own sustainability assessments
- **Consumer Education**: Building trust through honest communication about progress and challenges

### Key Outcomes

**For Small Chocolate Companies:**
- Practical steps to improve sustainability without expensive certifications
- Clear explanations of complex agricultural and trade practices
- Tools and frameworks for supply chain mapping
- Inspiration from real-world examples (Chocolatemakers model)

**For the Cacao Industry:**
- Research-backed recommendations for sustainable practices
- Documentation of successful direct trade models
- Analysis of agroforestry and permaculture applications
- Transparency framework that levels the playing field for small businesses

**For Farmers:**
- Improved economic opportunities through broadened responsibilities
- Access to better financing tools and digital payment systems
- Support for transitioning to sustainable farming practices
- Fairer pricing through direct trade relationships

### Research Methodology

The team employed multiple research methods:
- **Literature Review**: Academic papers, industry reports, certification standards
- **Expert Interviews**: Conversations with chocolate companies, cooperatives, and sustainability experts
- **Supply Chain Mapping**: Visual analysis of various supply chain models (Tony Chocolonely, Chocolatemakers, Fairtrade, mainstream)
- **Case Studies**: In-depth examination of successful sustainable sourcing models
- **Regulatory Analysis**: Review of EUDR requirements, Fairtrade standards, and Ghana cocoa regulations

### Visualizations & Deliverables

The project includes extensive visual documentation:
- Supply chain flow diagrams
- Agroforestry planting guides with multi-layer ecosystem illustrations
- Money flow mapping showing value distribution
- Comparison matrices for different sourcing approaches
- Step-by-step implementation guides with icons and illustrations

### Impact & Philosophy

The guide emphasizes that:
> "We believe small steps can lead to meaningful progress. Hopefully, this guide inspires you and makes you excited to start or continue walking on a sustainable path. A path that can lead to a better future for people, planet and profit."

Rather than claiming to solve all problems, the guide acknowledges complexity while providing practical entry points for improvement. It champions transparency over perfection, encouraging businesses to be honest about their journey rather than hiding behind incomplete certifications.

### Team Reflection

Suzie and Lonneke approached this project with fresh eyes, admitting: *"This industry was completely new to us, and we were excited to learn about the trading systems, agricultural practices, business negotiations and sustainability methods."*

Their outsider perspective allowed them to:
- Question assumptions in the industry
- Identify gaps in existing resources
- Create accessible explanations for complex topics
- Design a guide specifically for small businesses often overlooked by larger sustainability initiatives

### Collaboration & Co-Creation

The guide acknowledges contributions from:
- **Chocolatemakers**: For insights on direct trade and farmer empowerment
- **Multiple cacao cooperatives**: For on-the-ground farming perspectives
- **Industry experts**: For technical guidance on agroforestry and permaculture
- **Value Chain Hackers**: For mentorship and supply chain expertise

### Legacy & Future Use

This guide serves as:
1. **Educational Resource**: For students and businesses learning about sustainable cacao
2. **Implementation Playbook**: Step-by-step guides for companies ready to act
3. **Industry Advocacy**: Evidence for policy discussions about certification fairness
4. **Research Foundation**: Baseline for future Value Chain Hackers projects
