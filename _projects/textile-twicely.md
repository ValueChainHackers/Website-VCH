## Project Overview

Textile Twicely is a comprehensive circular economy initiative that addresses the urgent challenge of textile waste in the fashion industry. The project developed a practical framework for sustainable textile reuse and recycling, creating a business model that enables fashion brands and recycling facilities to collaborate more effectively.

### The Challenge

The fashion industry is one of the world's largest polluters, with over 92 million tons of textile waste generated annually. In the Netherlands alone, approximately 200,000 tons of textiles are discarded each year, with only 25% being collected for reuse or recycling. The remaining 75% ends up in landfills or incinerators, representing both an environmental crisis and a massive loss of valuable materials.

**Key Problems Identified:**
- **Fragmented Collection Systems:** Multiple collection points with inconsistent quality standards
- **Lack of Sorting Infrastructure:** Insufficient technology to sort textiles by material type and quality
- **Limited Recycling Capacity:** Few facilities capable of processing post-consumer textiles
- **Economic Barriers:** Recycled textiles often more expensive than virgin materials
- **Information Gaps:** Consumers lack knowledge about textile disposal options

## Research Approach

The team conducted extensive research over 5 months, combining literature review, stakeholder interviews, and market analysis to understand the textile waste ecosystem in the Netherlands.

### Methodology

**1. Literature Review**
- Analyzed EU Circular Economy Action Plan and Textile Strategy
- Studied successful circular textile models from Nordic countries
- Reviewed academic research on textile recycling technologies

**2. Stakeholder Interviews (15 conducted)**
- Fashion retailers (H&M, C&A, local boutiques)
- Textile recycling facilities (3 visits)
- Municipality waste management departments
- Charity organizations (Salvation Army, Red Cross)
- Textile designers and manufacturers

**3. Market Analysis**
- Mapped the Dutch textile supply chain
- Identified key bottlenecks and opportunities
- Analyzed cost structures of recycling vs. virgin production
- Benchmarked against international best practices

**4. Consumer Survey (n=250)**
- Understanding consumer attitudes toward sustainable fashion
- Identifying barriers to textile recycling
- Testing willingness to pay for recycled textiles

## Key Findings

### Supply Chain Insights

The Dutch textile value chain involves multiple disconnected actors:

**Collection → Sorting → Processing → Manufacturing → Retail**

**Critical Gaps:**
1. **Quality Degradation:** Each handoff point reduces material quality
2. **Information Loss:** Material composition data not transferred
3. **Economic Misalignment:** Value captured by middlemen, not innovators
4. **Technology Deficit:** Limited chemical recycling capabilities in NL

### Business Model Opportunities

The team identified three viable business models for circular textiles:

**Model 1: Take-Back Programs**
- Fashion brands collect used garments from customers
- Incentivize returns with discounts or store credit
- Partner with recyclers for material processing
- **Example:** H&M Garment Collecting program

**Model 2: Textile Sorting Hubs**
- Centralized facilities with advanced sorting technology
- Automated classification by fiber type and quality
- Create standardized material streams for recyclers
- **Innovation:** AI-powered textile recognition

**Model 3: Closed-Loop Fashion**
- Brands design for recyclability from the start
- Use mono-materials or easily separable components
- Maintain ownership of materials throughout lifecycle
- **Example:** Patagonia's Worn Wear program

## Solution: The Textile Twicely Framework

Based on research findings, the team developed a comprehensive framework for implementing circular textile systems in the Netherlands.

- C-grade: Fiber recycling (40%)
- D-grade: Downcycling or energy recovery (20%)

#### 4. **Stakeholder Platform**

**Goal:** Connect all actors in circular textile ecosystem

**Features:**
- Marketplace for recycled textile materials
- Quality certifications and standards
- Collaboration tools for brands and recyclers
- Data dashboard for transparency

**Users:**
- Fashion brands

- **Comparison:** Equal to removing 16,000 cars from roads

**Water Savings:**
- **Volume:** 1.5 billion liters annually
- **Impact:** Equivalent to water for 30,000 households

**Waste Diversion:**
- **Landfill:** 50,000 tons diverted annually
- **Recovery Rate:** Increase from 25% to 65% in target region

### Economic Impact

**Job Creation:**
- Direct jobs: 150-200 (sorting hub operations)
- Indirect jobs: 400-500 (collection, transport, processing)

**Market Potential:**
- Recycled textile market in NL: €50-75 million annually
- Growth rate: 15-20% CAGR projected

**Cost Savings for Brands:**
- Virgin material costs: €3-5/kg
