## About the Project

**"Li-Monti Maps is the 'Google Maps' of battery recycling — but instead of restaurants and shops, we map verified stakeholders across the lithium-ion battery value chain."**

Leoni Hartung and Manolie Bockhöfer developed Li-Monti Maps during their 6-month internship with Value Chain Hackers as part of their Global Project and Change Management program at Windesheim Zwolle. Recognizing that the lithium-ion battery recycling ecosystem suffers from fragmentation and lack of transparency, they created a digital platform concept that addresses three critical challenges: low collection rates, compliance struggles, and stakeholder invisibility.

The platform serves two primary user groups: **citizens** who need to find safe, certified battery drop-off locations, and **SMEs** seeking verified, ESG-compliant partners for collaboration in the recycling ecosystem. By creating a searchable digital map with verified listings, user ratings, and compliance support, Li-Monti Maps aims to build a transparent, trusted, and collaborative ecosystem that powers the circular battery economy.

## The Challenge

### Problem Statement

If you had a used lithium-ion battery at home right now, would you know where to safely and responsibly dispose of it? Most people don't — and the same is true for many businesses navigating the battery recycling ecosystem.

**The Pain Points:**

**Fragmentation**
- Recyclers, transporters, and manufacturers operate in silos
- No single source of truth for stakeholder information
- Difficult to find trusted partners

**Low Collection Rates**

## Team Reflection

### What We Learned

**Systems Thinking in Practice:**
Approaching battery recycling as a systems integration challenge revealed that the problem isn't lack of technology or regulation — it's lack of connection and visibility between actors who could solve it together.

**Lean Startup Approach:**
Rather than building everything at once, focusing on one high-impact use case (e.g., collection rate optimization) allows for MVP development and iterative improvement based on user feedback.

**Importance of Trust Infrastructure:**
In fragmented markets, trust mechanisms (verification, ratings, compliance tracking) are as important as the core technology.

### Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1: Defining Compliance Standards**
Different countries and regions have varying requirements.

**Solution:** Start with EU standards as baseline, create modular compliance framework that can adapt to regional variations.

**Challenge 2: Getting First Movers**
Platform requires critical mass to be valuable.

**Solution:** Target one geographic region and one stakeholder type first (e.g., recyclers in Netherlands), prove value, then expand.

**Challenge 3: Data Validation**
Ensuring verification information is accurate and up-to-date.

**Solution:** Combination of automated checks (API integration with registries), third-party certifications, and periodic audits.
