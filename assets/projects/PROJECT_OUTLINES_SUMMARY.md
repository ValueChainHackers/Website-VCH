## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

### For Projects with GitHub Data (ClearPaper, ClearRoots, SupplyLens, ChainForge, RecilienceScan, AI Scientist):
1. ✅ 3 Minute Rule pitch sections completed
2. ⚠️ Need to fill in:
   - Detailed sprint-by-sprint timeline
   - Team composition and capabilities
   - Agile ceremony schedule
   - Budget details
   - Visual assets (create folders + mockups)
   - Approval process

### For Projects Missing Context (MailServer, Formbricks, JupyterHub, App Building, n8n RAG, Docling):
1. ❌ Need basic project definition from Christiaan:
   - What is the actual purpose?
   - Current status (brainstorm/development/deployed)?
   - Team and resources
   - GitHub repository (if exists, or is it private?)

### For New Concept Projects (VCH Chatbot):
1. ✅ Good outline created based on typical architecture
2. ⚠️ Need decisions on:
   - Tech stack (which LLM, where to host)
   - Budget approval
   - Team assignment
   - Timeline approval

## 🔧 HOW TO COMPLETE THESE OUTLINES

### Step 1: Review Each File
Open each `-concept.md` file and look for `[TO FILL]` markers

### Step 2: Gather Information
For projects marked 🔴:
- Clarify basic project purpose
- Identify if GitHub repo exists (or is private)
- Get current status

For projects marked 🟡:
- Fill in timeline dates
- Assign team members
- Confirm budget
- Create visual assets

### Step 3: Fill in Sections
Use the template structure:
- 3 Minute Rule Pitch (6 questions)
- Timeline with sprint breakdown
- Agile ceremony schedule
- Team and resources
- Visual assets checklist

### Step 4: Create Asset Folders
For each project:
```bash
mkdir -p assets/projects/[project-slug]
mkdir -p assets/projects/[project-slug]/diagrams
mkdir -p assets/projects/[project-slug]/screenshots
```

Add README.md to document assets

### Step 5: Move to Website
Once filled, projects can be added to VCH website with appropriate status badges (Concept, In Development, Completed)

## 📞 QUESTIONS FOR CHRISTIAAN

**Priority 1 - Need Clarification:**
1. **MailServer** - What is this for? Custom or deployment of existing software?
2. **Formbricks** - Deployment details? Integration with RecilienceScan?
3. **JupyterHub** - Which courses use it? What simulations?
4. **App Building for Students** - What is this exactly? Tool, course, or templates?
5. **n8n RAG Visualization** - What's the workflow? How does this differ from SupplyLens?
6. **Docling** - Using IBM Docling or custom? For what purpose?

**Priority 2 - Need Decisions:**
7. **AI Scientist** - Go/no-go decision needed (high cost, experimental)
8. **ChainForge** - Fork with customizations or contribute upstream?
9. **VCH Chatbot** - Approve budget and tech stack?

**Priority 3 - Need Details:**
10. All projects marked 🟡 need timeline, team assignments, and visual assets

## 💡 RECOMMENDATIONS

**Quick Wins (Can complete soon):**
- RecilienceScan (already at M1, just need M2-M6 dates)
- VCH Chatbot (clear scope, need approval)
- ChainForge (upstream is solid, decide customization approach)

**Medium Effort:**
- ClearPaper (need legal validation plan)
- ClearRoots (need cooperative partnership confirmation)
- SupplyLens (need data source access clarification)

**High Effort / Need Research:**
- AI Scientist (feasibility study required)
- Projects missing basic definition (MailServer, App Building, n8n RAG, Docling)

**Consider Deprioritizing:**
- Projects without clear use case yet
- Projects duplicating existing tools
- Projects with unclear differentiation

---

**Next Action:** Review this summary and provide context for projects marked 🔴 (red) so outlines can be completed.
