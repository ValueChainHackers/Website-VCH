# AI Project Concept Template for Windesheim/VCH

**All projects follow Agile principles with iterative development, regular sprint cycles, and continuous stakeholder feedback.**

## PROJECT CONCEPT

### Basic Information
**Project Title:** n8n RAG Supply Chain Visualization

**Project Slug:** `n8n-rag-visualization`

**Concept Status:** brainstorm

**Category:** research / internal-tool

**GitHub Repository:** [TO FILL - Does this exist yet?]

---

## THE 3 MINUTE RULE PITCH

### 1. What is it?
[TO FILL - Using n8n (workflow automation) + RAG (AI retrieval) to visualize supply chain data? Please clarify the exact use case]

### 2. How does it work?
[TO FILL - Does n8n orchestrate data collection from sources → RAG processes it → generates visualization? Or something else?]

### 3. Are you sure?
n8n is proven for workflow automation. RAG works well for querying documents. The connection to "visualization" needs clarification.

### 4. Can you do it?
[TO FILL]

### 5. What's the value?
[TO FILL]

### 6. Are there any risks?
[TO FILL]

### The Problem

**What problem does this solve?**
[TO FILL - What supply chain visualization challenge are we solving?]

**Who has this problem?**
[TO FILL]

**How big is the problem?**
[TO FILL]

---

### The AI Solution

**What AI/ML technique would you use?**
- n8n workflows for automation and orchestration
- RAG for querying supply chain documents/data
- [TO FILL - What visualization library? D3.js? NetworkX? Custom?]

**What data would you need?**
[TO FILL - What supply chain data sources? ESG reports? Trade data? Shipping records?]

**Expected output/deliverable:**
[TO FILL - Interactive supply chain visualizations? Automated dashboard updates? Network graphs?]

## NOTES FOR COMPLETION

**Clarification Needed:**
This project needs more definition. Possible interpretations:

1. **n8n orchestrates RAG + Visualization:**
   - n8n workflows fetch supply chain data from sources
   - RAG processes documents to extract entities/relationships
   - Visualizations generated from extracted data

2. **Natural Language to Visualization:**
   - User asks question in natural language
   - RAG retrieves relevant supply chain data
   - n8n workflow generates appropriate visualization
   - Similar to "show me the coffee supply chain from Ethiopia"

3. **Automated Supply Chain Monitoring:**
   - n8n monitors supply chain data sources
   - RAG analyzes changes/patterns
   - Automated visualization updates

**Technology Context:**
- **n8n:** Open-source workflow automation (like Zapier)
- **RAG:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation for AI
- **Visualization:** Need to specify tool/library

**Questions to Answer:**
- [ ] What is the exact workflow: data source → processing → output?
- [ ] What types of supply chain visualizations? (Network graphs, flow diagrams, dashboards?)
- [ ] Is this related to SupplyLens project?
- [ ] Who are the users and what questions are they answering?
- [ ] Is n8n just orchestration or core to the value proposition?

[ALL SECTIONS TO FILL - Need detailed project specification first]
