## THE 3 MINUTE RULE PITCH

### 1. What is it?
A JupyterHub server where students can run supply chain simulation models without installing anything on their own computers.

### 2. How does it work?
[TO FILL - Students log in to JupyterHub, access pre-configured notebooks with supply chain simulation libraries, run Python/R code for supply chain modeling, all running on university servers]

### 3. Are you sure?
JupyterHub is proven infrastructure for multi-user notebooks. The question is what supply chain simulations we're providing and how they're structured.

### 4. Can you do it?
[TO FILL - Server infrastructure, simulation model development, student training materials]

### 5. What's the value?
Students learn supply chain modeling without technical setup barriers. Reproducible simulation environments. Shared computational resources. Can run complex simulations that wouldn't work on student laptops.

### 6. Are there any risks?
- Server costs and capacity limits
- Maintenance and updates
- User authentication and access control
- Simulation libraries may require significant compute

### The Problem

**What problem does this solve?**
Students waste hours troubleshooting Python installations and library conflicts instead of learning supply chain modeling. Different computer setups lead to "works on my machine" problems.

**Who has this problem?**
Supply chain students taking courses that involve simulation, optimization, or data analysis.

### The AI Solution

**What AI/ML technique would you use?**
[TO FILL - Are simulations using ML/AI, or is this traditional operations research simulations?]

**What data would you need?**
[TO FILL - Sample supply chain datasets for simulations, pre-built simulation models]

**Expected output/deliverable:**
Working JupyterHub server with supply chain simulation notebooks, student documentation, example simulations.

## NOTES FOR COMPLETION

**JupyterHub Context:**
- Multi-user Jupyter notebook server
- Students access via web browser
- Pre-configured environments (Python, R, libraries)
- Common for data science courses

**Need to gather:**
- [ ] What supply chain simulation libraries/tools are included?
- [ ] Which courses use this?
- [ ] Server specifications and capacity
- [ ] Authentication method (Windesheim SSO?)
- [ ] Example simulation topics (network optimization, inventory management, etc.)
- [ ] Current status - is it running or planned?
