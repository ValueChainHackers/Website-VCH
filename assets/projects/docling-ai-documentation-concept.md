# AI Project Concept Template for Windesheim/VCH

**All projects follow Agile principles with iterative development, regular sprint cycles, and continuous stakeholder feedback.**

---

## PROJECT CONCEPT

### Basic Information
**Project Title:** Docling - AI Documentation

**Project Slug:** `docling-ai-documentation`

**Concept Status:** brainstorm

**Category:** internal-tool / research

**GitHub Repository:** [TO FILL - Is this related to IBM's Docling or a custom project?]
**Possible Upstream:** https://github.com/DS4SD/docling (IBM document conversion tool)

---

## THE 3 MINUTE RULE PITCH

### 1. What is it?
[TO FILL - Is this using Docling for AI-assisted documentation? Automating VCH project documentation? Something else?]

### 2. How does it work?
[TO FILL - If using IBM Docling: converts PDFs/docs to structured data → AI processes → generates documentation?]

### 3. Are you sure?
[TO FILL - If using IBM Docling, it's an established tool. Need to clarify our use case.]

### 4. Can you do it?
[TO FILL]

### 5. What's the value?
[TO FILL - Automated documentation generation? Converting old docs? Extracting structured data from PDFs?]

### 6. Are there any risks?
[TO FILL]

---

### The Problem

**What problem does this solve?**
[TO FILL - VCH projects need better documentation? Converting legacy PDFs? Extracting data from supply chain documents?]

**Who has this problem?**
[TO FILL]

**How big is the problem?**
[TO FILL]

### The AI Solution

**What AI/ML technique would you use?**
[TO FILL - Document understanding? OCR? Structured extraction? Automated summarization?]

**What data would you need?**
[TO FILL - PDFs, research papers, supply chain documents?]

**Expected output/deliverable:**
[TO FILL - Markdown documentation? Structured data? API documentation?]

## NOTES FOR COMPLETION

**Docling Context (IBM):**
If related to https://github.com/DS4SD/docling:
- Converts documents (PDF, Word, etc.) to structured formats
- Extracts tables, figures, text with proper structure
- Could be used for:
  - Processing supply chain compliance documents
  - Extracting data from ESG reports
  - Converting research papers to structured data
  - Generating documentation from existing materials

**Clarification Needed:**
- [ ] Is this using IBM Docling or a custom tool?
- [ ] What specific documentation problem are we solving?
- [ ] Is this for VCH internal docs or processing external documents?
- [ ] How does AI assist - automated generation, summarization, extraction?
- [ ] What's the relationship to other VCH projects (ClearPaper, SupplyLens)?

**Possible Use Cases:**
1. Auto-generate documentation from VCH code repositories
2. Convert PDF compliance documents to structured data (→ ClearPaper)
3. Extract supply chain data from corporate reports (→ SupplyLens)
4. Generate student-friendly documentation from research papers
