TEMPLATE USAGE NOTES FOR AI
=============================================================================

CRITICAL RULES for Student Projects:

1. NEVER GUESS TEAM NAMES
   - Only use names from source documents
   - If names unclear, use "TBD" and ask user
   - Wrong names are unacceptable - accuracy is paramount

2. VERIFY ALL INFORMATION
   - Cross-check dates, institutions, partners across documents
   - Ensure consistency between presentations and reports
   - Flag contradictions for user review

3. READ ALL SOURCE MATERIALS
   - Read full PDFs, not just titles
   - Watch videos if provided
   - Review all Canva/Miro links
   - Check every document in project folder

4. RESPECT STUDENT WORK
   - Use students' own words from reflections when available
   - Credit their contributions appropriately
   - Highlight their learning and growth
   - Frame challenges as learning opportunities, not failures

5. FILE PATH RULES
   - ALWAYS use /assets/documents/project-name/
   - NEVER reference StudentProjects/ folder
   - Copy files from StudentProjects to assets before linking
   - See CRITICAL_CONSTRAINTS.md for full rules

When Filling Template:

1. Start by reading ALL available documents
2. Extract key information systematically:
   - Team names (from title pages, cover slides)
   - Dates (from document metadata, presentation slides)
   - Partners (from acknowledgments, stakeholder sections)
   - Methodology (from research sections)
   - Outcomes (from conclusions, results sections)

3. Write in students' voice when possible
   - Use their reflections and quotes
   - Maintain their tone and perspective
   - Preserve their terminology and framing

4. Structure for clarity
   - Challenge → Research → Solution → Impact
   - Focus on the journey, not just deliverable
   - Include both successes and learning moments

5. Be specific with examples
   - "Interviewed 15 chocolate manufacturers" not "talked to companies"
   - "Mapped 23 supply chain touchpoints" not "analyzed supply chains"
   - "Reduced waste by 30%" not "improved sustainability"

Content Quality Standards:
- Professional but accessible - students should be proud to share
- Accurate - every fact verified from source materials
- Comprehensive - tells complete story of project
- Respectful - honors students' work and learning
- Actionable - clear outcomes and recommendations

SEO Best Practices:
- Title: Official project name (don't modify)
- Description: Focus on problem solved and beneficiaries
- Tags: Mix of industry domain and methods (e.g., "Cacao Industry", "Supply Chain Mapping")
- Images: Include team photos if available (with permission)

Examples of Good Content:
See _projects/cacao-guide.md - comprehensive, accurate, well-structured
Emphasizes both deliverable and learning journey
