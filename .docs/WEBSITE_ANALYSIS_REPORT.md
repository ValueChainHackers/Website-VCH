## Part 2: Critical Missing Information

### üö® **CRITICAL GAPS**

#### **1. Student Project Information**
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **SEVERELY INCOMPLETE**

**What's Missing:**
- Real student names and photos
- Actual project descriptions (currently generic placeholder text)
- Project team compositions
- Real project outcomes and results
- Student testimonials
- Semester/cohort organization
- Individual student portfolios

**Current Situation:**
- 8 project pages exist but contain mostly "TBD" placeholders
- Project descriptions are AI-generated guesses based on titles only
- No actual student work is showcased
- No connection to real GitHub repositories

**Impact:**
- Students can't showcase their work
- Potential partners can't see real outcomes
- Website doesn't reflect actual VCH activities

**Files Affected:**
- [_projects/lemonti.md](_projects/lemonti.md) and 7 other project files
- [index.html](index.html:107-196) - project cards section

**Recommendation:**
```
PRIORITY: URGENT
ACTION: Collect from each of the 12 active teams:
  - 2-3 sentence project description
  - Team member names (3-5 students per team)
  - GitHub repository URL
  - 1 key outcome/deliverable
  - 1 photo of team or project demo
  - LinkedIn post URL (if they posted about it)
```

---

#### **2. Event Information**
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **INCOMPLETE**

**What's Missing:**
- Detailed event descriptions
- Registration system (currently using mailto: links)
- Past event archive with photos/recaps
- Recurring event schedule
- Event calendar integration
- Workshop materials/recordings
- Event attendance statistics

**Current Situation:**
- [index.html](index.html:208-289) has 3 events with basic info:
  - October 30th Final Event (just a date, no details)
  - AI Workshop Series (very generic description)
  - Business Partnership Meetup (placeholder content)
- Registration links go to `mailto:info@valuechainhackers.xyz`
- No past events shown
- No downloadable materials

**Impact:**
- Hard to attract event attendees
- No proof of past success
- Difficult event registration process

**Recommendation:**
```
PRIORITY: HIGH
SHORT-TERM: Use Meetup.com or Eventbrite for registration
MEDIUM-TERM: Add past events archive section
LONG-TERM: Integrate Google Calendar or custom event system
```

---

#### **3. LinkedIn Feed**
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **STATIC PLACEHOLDERS ONLY**

**Current Implementation:**
- [index.html](index.html:375-449) has LinkedIn feed section
- Shows 3 **hardcoded** example posts (NOT pulling real data)
- Links to LinkedIn company page but doesn't embed real content

**Why It's Not Dynamic:**
LinkedIn doesn't provide a public API for feed embedding without:
- OAuth authentication (requires user login)
- Company page admin access
- LinkedIn Marketing Developer Platform access (costly)

**Current Posts (Static Examples):**
1. "Fall 2025 cohort is underway! 5 student teams..."
2. "Just wrapped up our practical AI workshop series..."
3. "Congrats to Twicely - our Spring 2025 winner..."

**Impact:**
- Feed will become outdated quickly
- Manual updates required monthly
- No actual social proof from LinkedIn

**Recommendation:**
```
PRIORITY: MEDIUM
OPTION A: Manual monthly updates (easiest)
  - Update 3 posts each month with real VCH LinkedIn content
  - Copy actual post text and links

OPTION B: Use RSS Bridge (intermediate)
  - Set up RSS feed scraper for LinkedIn company page
  - Requires self-hosted service or external tool

OPTION C: Remove feed entirely (pragmatic)
  - Replace with "Latest News" section
  - Pull from local blog posts or announcements
  - More control over content

RECOMMENDED: Option A (manual updates monthly)
  - Assign to: Christiaan + Maxime
  - Frequency: 1st of each month
  - Time required: 15 minutes
```

---

#### **4. Discord Integration**
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **BASIC LINK ONLY**

**Current Implementation:**
- Discord invite link: `https://discord.gg/mkbjsQsV`
- Link appears in:
  - [_layouts/default.html](_layouts/default.html:237) - footer
  - [_team/christiaan-verhoef.md](_team/christiaan-verhoef.md:48) - his profile

**What's Missing:**
- No Discord widget showing online members
- No member count display
- No recent activity feed
- No embedded Discord chat
- No event announcements from Discord
- No integration with website updates

**Impact:**
- Low Discord visibility
- Hard to gauge community activity
- Missed opportunity for engagement
