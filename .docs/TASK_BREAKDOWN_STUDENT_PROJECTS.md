## üìù NOTES FOR NEXT STEPS

### For Li-Monti (CRM Track):
- PowerPoint is 21.8MB - may contain detailed slides with team info
- Filenames suggest lithium/battery supply chain focus
- "Shark tank" reference suggests pitch/competition element
- Multiple iterations of docs suggest evolving scope

### For Textile Track:
- **CRITICAL:** No team names in materials - must ask user or access Canva
- Canva links may require login/permissions
- Miro board might have team member info
- Consider asking user directly for team names before proceeding

### For Photo Galleries:
- Dates are in future (Oct 2025, June 2025) - but files exist
- May be dated incorrectly or from previous semester
- **Ask user for event context before creating galleries**
- Consider creating unified "Events & Activities" page vs. separate galleries

---

## üöÄ RECOMMENDED NEXT ACTIONS

1. **Continue with Li-Monti research** - Open PowerPoint and Word docs
2. **Ask user about Textile Track team** - Cannot proceed without names
3. **Ask user about photo gallery context** - Need event descriptions
4. **Commit and push Cacao Guide updates** - Task 1 is complete and ready

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT REMINDERS

- **Never guess team names** - Only use confirmed information
- **Never invent project details** - Only use documented facts
- **Ask user when stuck** - Better to ask than assume
- **Test everything before marking complete** - Build, links, mobile, etc.
- **Each folder is a different team** - Don't mix information
