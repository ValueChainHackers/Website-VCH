## üéØ DEFINITION OF DONE CHECKLIST

For each task to be considered "done", it must meet:

### Content Accuracy
- [ ] All information is factually correct and verified against source documents
- [ ] Team member names are accurate (not guessed or placeholder)
- [ ] Dates and timelines match actual project duration
- [ ] No placeholder text remains

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Jekyll builds successfully without errors
- [ ] All links are valid and functional
- [ ] Images are optimized (WebP + fallback)
- [ ] Mobile responsive design works
- [ ] No console errors

### Quality Standards
- [ ] Text is clear, professional, typo-free
- [ ] Grammar and spelling are correct
- [ ] Tone matches VCH website style
- [ ] SEO metadata is complete

### Integration
- [ ] Project appears correctly in navigation
- [ ] Project cards link to detail pages
- [ ] Related content is cross-linked

---

### Task 6: LinkedIn Feed Fix
**Status:** ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING
**Priority:** HIGH
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours

**Current Issue:**
- LinkedIn feed on homepage is currently using placeholder/client-side approach
- Needs Jekyll-compatible STATIC implementation (no client-side JavaScript)
- Must work with GitHub Pages static site generation

**Constraints:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL:** This is a Jekyll static site hosted through GitHub with GitHub Actions
- Cannot use client-side JavaScript to fetch LinkedIn posts
- Solution must generate HTML at build time

**Possible Approaches:**
1. **Manual curation:** User updates a YAML data file with LinkedIn post details
2. **GitHub Actions workflow:** Fetch LinkedIn posts during build (requires LinkedIn API credentials)
3. **RSS-to-Jekyll:** If LinkedIn provides RSS, parse during build like news feeds
4. **Embed widget:** Use official LinkedIn embed (but may have client-side limitations)

**Next Steps:**
1. Check current implementation in homepage
2. Determine which approach is feasible (likely manual curation for start)
3. Create `_data/linkedin_posts.yml` structure
4. Update homepage to read from data file
5. Document how user updates the feed

**Questions for User:**
- Do you have LinkedIn API credentials?
- How often do you want to update LinkedIn feed?
- Manual updates acceptable, or need automation?

---

### Task 7: Verify News Pages Working
**Status:** ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours

**Background:**
- AI news and Sustainability news pages were rebuilt with Jekyll-compatible architecture
- Now use GitHub Actions + Python + Jekyll data files instead of client-side JavaScript
- Workflow: `.github/workflows/update-news-feeds.yml`
- Python script: `scripts/fetch_news_feeds.py`
- Data files: `_data/ai_news.yml` and `_data/sustainability_news.yml`

**Verification Needed:**
1. Check if GitHub Actions workflow has run successfully
2. Verify data files are populated with news articles
3. Test that pages display content correctly
4. Confirm RSS feeds are being fetched properly
5. Test manual workflow trigger (if needed)

**Potential Issues:**
- Python dependencies may need to be installed in workflow
- RSS feeds may be blocked or rate-limited
- YAML formatting issues
- Liquid template syntax errors

**Next Steps:**
1. Check GitHub Actions runs: `gh run list`
2. View latest workflow logs: `gh run view --log`
3. Check if data files have content: `cat _data/ai_news.yml`
4. Visit pages to verify display
5. Manually trigger workflow if needed: `gh workflow run update-news-feeds.yml`

## üìù NOTES FOR NEXT STEPS

### For Li-Monti (CRM Track):
- PowerPoint is 21.8MB - may contain detailed slides with team info
- Filenames suggest lithium/battery supply chain focus
- "Shark tank" reference suggests pitch/competition element
- Multiple iterations of docs suggest evolving scope

### For Textile Track:
- **CRITICAL:** No team names in materials - must ask user or access Canva
- Canva links may require login/permissions
- Miro board might have team member info
- Consider asking user directly for team names before proceeding

### For Photo Galleries:
- Dates are in future (Oct 2025, June 2025) - but files exist
- May be dated incorrectly or from previous semester
- **Ask user for event context before creating galleries**
- Consider creating unified "Events & Activities" page vs. separate galleries

---

## üöÄ RECOMMENDED NEXT ACTIONS

1. **Continue with Li-Monti research** - Open PowerPoint and Word docs
2. **Ask user about Textile Track team** - Cannot proceed without names
3. **Ask user about photo gallery context** - Need event descriptions
4. **Commit and push Cacao Guide updates** - Task 1 is complete and ready

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT REMINDERS

- **Never guess team names** - Only use confirmed information
- **Never invent project details** - Only use documented facts
- **Ask user when stuck** - Better to ask than assume
- **Test everything before marking complete** - Build, links, mobile, etc.
- **Each folder is a different team** - Don't mix information
