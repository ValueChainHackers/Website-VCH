## üìã Task Summary
Create standardized markdown templates for 4 content types: VCH Projects, Research Outputs, Student Projects, and Events. Each template should include all fields that AI would need to create high-quality content.

## üéØ Context

### Background
The VCH website has multiple content types that need consistent structure:
1. **VCH Projects** - Projects Value Chain Hackers is building (e.g., OpenWebUI integration, tools)
2. **Research Outputs** - Research papers, studies, and academic work
3. **Student Projects** - Semester-long student internship projects (e.g., Cacao Guide, Li-Monti)
4. **Events** - Brainstorming sessions, roast days, presentations, workshops

### Why This Matters
- **Consistency:** Ensures all content has the same high-quality structure
- **AI Efficiency:** AI knows exactly what information to extract and where to put it
- **User Experience:** Visitors get consistent, complete information across all content
- **Maintenance:** Easy to add new content by filling in template fields

### Related Work
- Related to student project updates (Tasks 2-3)
- Supports photo gallery creation (Tasks 4-5)
- Foundation for future content additions
- Complements existing `_projects/` Jekyll structure

## üåç Environment

### Technical Stack
- **Static Site Generator:** Jekyll 4.x
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages
- **Content Format:** Markdown with YAML front matter
- **Templating:** Liquid

### Repository Structure
```
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _projects/         # Student project pages (Jekyll collection)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _research/         # Research outputs (to be created)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _events/           # Events (to be created)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _data/            # YAML data files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ documents/    # PDFs, presentations
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ images/       # Photos, graphics
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .docs/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/    # NEW: Markdown templates location
```

### Critical Constraints
‚ö†Ô∏è **MUST READ:** [`.docs/CRITICAL_CONSTRAINTS.md`](.docs/CRITICAL_CONSTRAINTS.md)

**Key Rules:**
1. Templates should include fields for `assets/documents/` references, NOT `StudentProjects/`
2. Must work with Jekyll front matter (YAML)
3. Should include SEO metadata fields
4. Must support mobile-responsive design requirements

## üéØ Goal

### Primary Objective
Create 4 comprehensive markdown templates in `.docs/templates/`:
1. `vch-project-template.md` - For VCH-built projects
2. `research-template.md` - For research outputs

## üí¨ Notes & Comments

### Design Principles for Templates

1. **Completeness over Brevity** - Better to have a field and not use it than to need a field and not have it
2. **Clarity over Cleverness** - Field names should be self-explanatory
3. **Examples over Explanations** - Show, don't just tell
4. **Guidance over Assumptions** - Comment what goes in each field
5. **Flexibility with Structure** - Some fields optional, some required

### Content Type Distinctions

- **VCH Projects** = Value Chain Hackers building something (focus: technical implementation)
- **Research** = Academic output (focus: methodology and findings)
- **Student Projects** = Internship deliverables (focus: learning journey and practical outcomes)
- **Events** = Gatherings and activities (focus: who, what, when, outcomes)

---

## ü§ñ AI Instructions

### What to Read First
1. `.docs/CRITICAL_CONSTRAINTS.md` - File reference rules
2. `_projects/cacao-guide.md` - Example of well-structured project
3. `.docs/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` - Quality standards

### What to Create

**For Each Template:**
1. YAML front matter with ALL relevant fields
2. Markdown content sections with descriptive headings
3. Inline comments explaining each field (using `# Comment` syntax)
4. Example values showing format and style
5. Mark required vs. optional fields clearly

**Template Structure:**
```markdown
---
# [REQUIRED] Project title - Keep concise, 3-8 words
title: "Example Project Title"

# [REQUIRED] Brief description - 1-2 sentences, <160 characters for SEO
description: "Example description"

# [OPTIONAL] Additional field
field_name: "example value"
---

## Section Heading

```

### Quality Standards

- **Field naming:** lowercase, underscores, descriptive (e.g., `team_members`, not `team`)
- **Comments:** Above each field, explain what it's for
- **Examples:** Show realistic data, not "Lorem ipsum"
- **Formatting:** Use proper YAML syntax (strings in quotes, lists with dashes)

### If You Get Stuck
1. Look at `_projects/cacao-guide.md` for inspiration
2. Check Jekyll documentation for field naming conventions
3. Think: "What would I want to know if I was filling this in?"
4. Ask user if uncertain about required fields

### Success Criteria
Templates are done when:
- A human can fill them in without confusion
- AI can extract information from source materials and map to fields
- Jekyll can process the front matter without errors
- The resulting pages look professional and complete
