## Why We're Building This

Supply chains are complex, fragmented, and often misunderstood‚Äîyet they impact everything from climate change to social equity. We believe that **transparent knowledge sharing** accelerates innovation.

This blog is part of our mission to:
- Make supply chain knowledge accessible to everyone
- Showcase student and partner achievements
- Foster a community of practice around sustainable innovation
- Bridge the gap between academia and industry

## What Makes Our Approach Different?

**Student-Led Innovation**
Unlike traditional consultancies, our projects are driven by curious, motivated students working alongside industry partners. This brings fresh perspectives and rigorous academic research to practical challenges.

**Open & Collaborative**
We believe in open-source tools, transparent methodologies, and sharing what we learn. Check out our [GitHub repositories]({{ site.github_url }}) for code, datasets, and resources.

**Impact-Focused**
We're not interested in theoretical exercises‚Äîevery project we take on aims for real-world impact, whether that's reducing waste, improving efficiency, or creating fairer supply chains.
