## Why This Workshop?

Artificial intelligence is no longer a buzzword—it's transforming how supply chains operate worldwide. From predicting customer demand to optimizing warehouse layouts, AI delivers measurable results: reduced costs, faster deliveries, and happier customers.

But **where do you start?**

Most AI workshops are either too technical (overwhelming for business professionals) or too theoretical (lacking practical application). This workshop bridges the gap.

### What Makes This Workshop Different?

**🎯 Practical, Not Theoretical**
We focus on real-world applications you can implement immediately. Every concept ties directly to supply chain challenges you face.

**🤝 Hands-On Learning**
You won't just watch slides—you'll build an actual demand forecasting model during the workshop. Leave with code you can adapt to your own data.

**📊 Real Case Studies**
Learn from Dutch companies (large and small) that successfully implemented AI in their supply chains. Understand what worked, what didn't, and why.

**🌐 Hybrid Format**
Can't travel to Zwolle? Join online! Our hybrid format ensures everyone gets the full workshop experience, regardless of location.

**🎓 Beginner-Friendly**
No AI or coding background required. If you understand supply chains, you'll understand this workshop.

## Who Should NOT Attend?

To be transparent, this workshop might not be right for you if:

- You're already building AI models regularly (this is an intro/intermediate level)
- You're looking for deep technical training on neural network architectures
- You expect a sales pitch for specific AI software (we focus on concepts and open-source tools)

If you're advanced in AI but new to supply chain applications, you'll still find value in the case studies and industry-specific insights.

## What Participants Say

> *"I came in skeptical about AI hype but left with practical tools I could use immediately. Within 2 weeks of the workshop, we implemented a simple forecasting model that improved our inventory accuracy by 18%."*
> — **Sarah de Jong**, Supply Chain Analyst, Dutch Retailer

> *"As a student, I appreciated how Christiaan made complex AI concepts accessible. The hands-on coding exercise was challenging but supportive, and now I feel confident exploring AI projects on my own."*
> — **Tom Hendriks**, International Business Student

> *"The networking was just as valuable as the content. I connected with 3 companies exploring similar AI challenges, and we've continued collaborating months later."*
> — **Lisa Vermeer**, Logistics Startup Founder
