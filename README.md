# Value Chain Hackers Website — Comprehensive Handover Report

## 1. Overview
The **Value Chain Hackers (VCH)** website is the public-facing hub of a Windesheim University research initiative under the **Lectoraat Supply Chain Finance**.  
It showcases collaborative research between students, teachers, and industry partners focused on making supply chains more sustainable, transparent, and financially viable.  
The website serves as both a **knowledge archive** and a **community entry point**.

---

## 2. Core Function
The website’s primary function is to make the work of Value Chain Hackers visible and actionable.

- **Transparency:** Share completed research outputs, student projects, and partnerships.  
- **Engagement:** Invite companies, academics, and students to participate in workshops and future projects.  
- **Credibility:** Establish VCH as a professional, forward-thinking research lab focused on social and environmental impact in supply chains.  
- **Community Gateway:** Link visitors to the Discord server where ongoing collaboration happens.

## 3. Primary Goal
> “To turn research into action by connecting students, researchers, and partners through transparent, accessible, and inspiring content.”

Success is measured by:
- Growth in project visibility (site visits, downloads).  
- Increased number of external partnerships and student participation.  
- Engagement through Discord and event signups.

## 9. Underlying Method — Theory U
The Value Chain Hackers process follows **Theory U** (Otto Scharmer, MIT).  
This approach guides how projects evolve from observation to transformation.

| Phase | Description | VCH Example |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **1. Downloading** | Observe and question existing supply chain patterns. | Students research problems in current systems. |
| **2. Seeing** | Collect data and perspectives from all stakeholders. | Interviews, field studies, and data mapping. |
| **3. Sensing** | Build shared awareness of challenges. | Joint workshops and discussions. |
| **4. Presencing** | Reflect deeply and allow new ideas to emerge. | Retreats or creative sessions. |
| **5. Crystallizing** | Define clear project intentions. | Set research goals and hypotheses. |
| **6. Prototyping** | Develop and test pilot solutions. | Student or partner-led prototype projects. |
| **7. Performing** | Scale and share successful outcomes. | Published reports, events, new partnerships. |

This process aligns academic research with real-world innovation cycles.
